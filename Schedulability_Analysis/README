#In this task, we developed an analysis program implementing various schedulability testing approaches for 
 EDF, RM, and DM schedule algorithms and also a comparative analysis of the schedulability of EDF, RM and DM 
 algorithms using synthetic tasks sets.

#In the first part, the task sets information is read from an input file and the schedulability using EDF, RM 
 and DM are analysed.

#In the second part, synthetic task sets are generating and the schedulability using EDF, RM and DM are analysed.

#In the synthetic tasks generation, utilizations for each task set are generating using UUnifast algorithm.

#The periods of each task set are randomly generated within a chosen goemetric ranges.

#Worst case execution time of each task set are then generated using utilization*period.

#Deadlines are generated for four different cases   (Ci - worst case execution time, Ti - period)
	#10 tasks in each task set and the deadline distribution of [Ci, ,Ti]
	#25 tasks in each task set and the deadline distribution of [Ci, ,Ti]
	#10 tasks in each task set and the deadline distribution of [Ci +(Ti-Ci)/2 ,Ti]
	#25 tasks in each task set and the deadline distribution of [Ci+(Ti-Ci)/2 ,Ti]

#Each scheduling algorithm is run on each task set for each of the above mentioned case and the % of task sets
 that are schedulable is noted and plotted.

#The algorithmic approach for each task set is explained in Report.pdf

#The output of the program is
		#For first part - printed whether the task set is schedulable or not by each scheduling algorithm
						- printed the Worst case execution time in case of Response Time analysis
						- printed first missing deadline in case of loading factor approach

		#For second part - printed the number of tasks schedulable by each algorithm in each case for 10 utilization points
